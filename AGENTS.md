# AGENTS.md — AI Operating Manual for HEXA Vision

This document is the **single source of truth** and the permanent operating manual for all AI Agents contributing to the HEXA Vision project. Every agent must read and adhere to these guidelines to ensure architectural consistency, production-grade quality, and seamless collaboration.

---

## 1. Project Overview
HEXA Vision (HexaStudio.net) is a world-class 3D Architecture Visualization platform. It is designed to showcase architectural projects through immersive, interactive 3D experiences with an "Awwwards-level" visual aesthetic, backed by an enterprise-grade software architecture.

## 2. Mission
To bridge the gap between technical architectural data and high-end visual storytelling, providing a seamless, high-performance web interface for exploring 3D architectural spaces.

## 3. Vision
To become the industry standard for online architectural presentations, where performance, accessibility, and visual fidelity coexist without compromise.

## 5. Repository Structure
The project follows a monorepo structure:
- `/apps/frontend`: Next.js application.
- `/apps/backend`: NestJS API.
- `/apps/cms`: Strapi CMS.
- `/packages/types`: Shared TypeScript interfaces and DTOs.
- `/packages/utils`: Shared helper functions.
- `/docker`: Infrastructure configurations (traefik, postgres, redis, minio, etc.).
- `/docs`: High-level architectural documentation.
- `/scripts`: Deployment and setup scripts.

## 6. Architecture Principles
- **Separation of Concerns:** Strictly decouple UI, Business Logic, and Data Management.
- **BFF Pattern:** The NestJS API acts as a Backend-for-Frontend, aggregating data from Strapi and internal DBs.
- **Type-First Development:** Always define shared types in `/packages/types` before implementing features.
- **Statelessness:** Backend services must remain stateless to allow horizontal scaling.
- **Security-by-Default:** Data stores are isolated on the `internal` Docker network; no public exposure of DB ports.

## 7. Coding Standards
- **TypeScript:** Strict mode enabled. No `any` types. All function signatures must be typed.
- **Naming:** 
  - Components: PascalCase (`ProjectGallery.tsx`).
  - Functions/Variables: camelCase (`calculateLOD()`).
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_SESSIONS`).
  - Files: kebab-case (`user-auth.service.ts`).
- **Formatting:** Prettier/ESLint configured. No trailing spaces.
- **Comments:** Do NOT add comments unless explaining "Why", not "What". Code must be self-documenting.

## 8. Git Workflow
- **Linear History:** Prefer rebasing over merging for feature branches.
- **Atomic Commits:** Each commit should address one logical change.
- **Verification:** Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` before any commit.

## 9. Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code. Protected.
- `develop`: Integration branch for features.
- `feature/feature-name`: Individual feature development.
- `bugfix/issue-id`: Targeted bug fixes.
- `hotfix/issue-id`: Critical production fixes.

## 10. Commit Convention
Follow Conventional Commits:
- `feat: ...` (New feature)
- `fix: ...` (Bug fix)
- `docs: ...` (Documentation changes)
- `style: ...` (Formatting, missing semi-colons, etc; no code change)
- `refactor: ...` (Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature)
- `perf: ...` (Performance improvement)
- `test: ...` (Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests)
- `chore: ...` (Updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc)

## 11. Pull Request Rules
- **Description:** Must include "What", "Why", and "How to test".
- **Screenshots:** Required for all UI/UX changes.
- **Checklist:** Must pass CI (Build, Lint, Test).
- **Approvals:** Minimum one human or senior agent review.

## 12. Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Does it follow the established architecture?
- [ ] Are types strictly defined (no `any`)?
- [ ] Does it introduce any performance regressions in 3D rendering?
- [ ] Is it accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)?
- [ ] Are secrets handled via environment variables?
- [ ] Is there a corresponding update in the documentation?

## 13. Design System Rules
- **Tailwind 4:** Use utility classes exclusively. Avoid custom CSS files.
- **Consistency:** Use a centralized `tailwind.config` for colors, spacing, and typography.
- **Responsiveness:** Mobile-first approach. Test on 320px, 768px, 1024px, and 1440px.

## 14. UI/UX Principles
- **Awwwards Aesthetic:** Focus on whitespace, typography, and smooth transitions.
- **Minimalism:** Remove any element that does not add value to the visualization.
- **Feedback:** Every user interaction must have a visual or haptic response.

## 15. Three.js Guidelines
- **Optimization:** Use `InstancedMesh` for repetitive objects.
- **Memory Management:** Always dispose of geometries and materials when components unmount.
- **Asset Loading:** Use `useGLTF` from `@react-three/drei` with Draco compression.
- **Lighting:** Prefer baked lighting for static scenes; use a single `DirectionalLight` for dynamic elements.

## 16. Animation Guidelines
- **GSAP:** Use for complex, timeline-based cinematic sequences.
- **Framer Motion:** Use for simple UI transitions and layout animations.
- **Easing:** Avoid linear animations; use `power3.out` or custom cubic-beziers for a natural feel.
- **Orchestration:** Animations must be synchronized with the 3D camera movement.

## 17. Performance Budget
- **Initial Load:** LCP < 1.2s.
- **Frame Rate:** Stable 60 FPS in the 3D scene.
- **Bundle Size:** Keep frontend JS bundle < 200KB (initial).
- **Asset Size:** Individual 3D models < 5MB (compressed).

## 18. Accessibility Standards
- **Dual-Interface:** Implement a semantic DOM parallel to the 3D scene for screen readers.
- **Keyboard Nav:** All 3D hotspots must be reachable via `Tab`.
- **Reduced Motion:** Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` by disabling heavy animations.
- **Contrast:** Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for all text.

## 19. SEO Standards
- **Dynamic Metadata:** Use Next.js `generateMetadata` for every project/blog page.
- **Structured Data:** Implement JSON-LD for `ProfessionalService` and `Project`.
- **Sitemaps:** Automatically generate `sitemap.xml` from Strapi content.

## 20. Security Rules
- **Internal Net:** No DB/Cache ports exposed to the public.
- **Input Validation:** All API inputs must be validated via `class-validator`.
- **Headers:** Traefik must enforce HSTS, X-Frame-Options, and CSP.
- **Auth:** Passwords must be hashed (Bcrypt); tokens must have a strict TTL.

## 21. Documentation Standards
- **Living Docs:** Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` immediately when architectural changes occur.
- **Self-Documenting:** Prioritize clean code over comments.
- **API Docs:** Keep Swagger updated via NestJS decorators.

## 22. Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** Logic-heavy utilities in `/packages/utils` and Backend Services.
- **Integration Tests:** API endpoints (Auth, Project retrieval).
- **E2E Tests:** Playwright for critical flows (User $\rightarrow$ Project $\rightarrow$ 3D View).
- **Visual Regression:** Periodic screenshots of 3D scenes to detect regressions.

## 23. CI/CD Rules
- **Pipeline:** GitHub Actions $\rightarrow$ GHCR $\rightarrow$ SSH Deploy.
- **Builds:** Only `main` and `develop` branches can trigger deployment.
- **Healthchecks:** Deployments must be verified via `/api/health` before traffic switch.

## 24. Docker & Deployment Rules
- **Image Size:** Use `-alpine` versions of images to minimize footprint.
- **Persistence:** All data must be stored in named Docker volumes.
- **Updates:** Use Watchtower for automated image updates.

## 25. CMS Integration Strategy
- **Source of Truth:** Strapi is the master for all content.
- **BFF Layer:** The Frontend calls the Backend, which in turn fetches and formats Strapi data.
- **Webhooks:** Use Strapi webhooks to trigger Next.js ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration).

## 26. Error Handling Standards
- **Frontend:** Use React Error Boundaries for the 3D scene to prevent whole-page crashes.
- **Backend:** Use a global `ExceptionFilter` in NestJS for consistent error responses.
- **Reporting:** All critical errors must be sent to Sentry.

## 27. Logging Standards
- **Format:** JSON logging for production.
- **Aggregation:** All logs shipped to Loki via Promtail.
- **Levels:** Use `info` for flow, `warn` for recoverable issues, `error` for failures.

## 28. Environment Variables Policy
- **Naming:** Use clear prefixes (`NEXT_PUBLIC_`, `SENTRY_`, `DATABASE_`).
- **Safety:** Never commit `.env`. Always update `.env.example`.
- **Validation:** Backend must validate existence of required env vars at startup.

## 29. Definition of Done (DoD)
- [ ] Code follows all standards and is linted.
- [ ] Feature is tested (Unit/Integration).
- [ ] UI is visually identical to design (if applicable).
- [ ] Performance budget is maintained.
- [ ] A11y and SEO standards are met.
- [ ] Documentation updated.
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved.

## 30. Sprint Workflow
1. **Planning:** Break down tasks into the `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`.
2. **Execution:** Implement feature $\rightarrow$ Test $\rightarrow$ Lint.
3. **Verification:** Run full build and health checks.
4. **Closure:** Update `todowrite` and commit.

## 31. AI Agent Responsibilities
- **Architect Agent:** Owns the structure and technical debt.
- **UI/UX Agent:** Owns the visual fidelity and a11y.
- **DevOps Agent:** Owns the infra and CI/CD.
- **QA Agent:** Owns the testing and verification.

## 32. Autonomous Execution Policy
- **Proactive Implementation:** Agents are encouraged to implement follow-up tasks (e.g., updating docs after code changes) without being asked.
- **No Guessing:** If a dependency or API is unknown, the agent MUST search the codebase or ask the user.
- **Safety First:** Never perform destructive actions (e.g., `docker compose down -v`) without explicit user approval.

## 33. Stop Conditions
Stop and request human intervention if:
- A critical architectural conflict is discovered.
- A third-party library is fundamentally incompatible with the stack.
- Access to required credentials or external APIs is missing.
- Security vulnerability is found that requires a pivot.

## 34. Release Checklist
- [ ] All critical bugs resolved.
- [ ] SSL/TLS verified on all subdomains.
- [ ] Sentry DSNs configured for production.
- [ ] Cloudflare WAF rules active.
- [ ] Database backups verified.

## 35. Maintenance Guidelines
- **Dependency Updates:** Monthly review of `package.json` for updates.
- **Log Rotation:** Ensure Loki/Promtail are not consuming excessive disk space.
- **Asset Audit:** Periodically prune unused 3D models from MinIO.
