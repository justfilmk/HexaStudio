# Security Report: HEXA Vision

**Report Date:** 2026-06-30  
**Grade:** B+ (structural) / C (operational hardening pending)

---

## 1. Security Strengths

| Control | Implementation | Status |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Network isolation | Postgres/Redis on `internal` network | Active |
| Secret management | `.env` gitignored; `generate-secrets.sh` | Active |
| Required env validation | `${VAR:?required}` in compose | Active |
| HTTP security headers | Traefik secure-headers middleware | Active |
| Rate limiting | Traefik (100 avg) + NestJS Throttler | Active |
| Input validation | NestJS ValidationPipe (whitelist) | Active |
| Helmet | NestJS middleware | Active |
| Non-root containers | nextjs/nestjs/strapi users | Active |
| No hardcoded secrets in repo | Verified | Pass |
| CORS | Configurable origins | Active |

---

## 2. Identified Risks

| Risk | Severity | Detail | Mitigation | Status |
|------|----------|--------|------------|--------|
| Unencrypted HTTP | High | ACME disabled in `.env.example` | Enable Let's Encrypt / Cloudflare Origin | Pending |
| MinIO anonymous download | Medium | `init-buckets.sh` sets public read | Private buckets + presigned URLs | Pending |
| Traefik dashboard insecure | Medium | `api.insecure: true` on :8080 | Disable or protect with auth | Pending |
| CMS admin exposed | Medium | `cms.localhost/admin` | IP allowlist + 2FA | Pending |
| Monitoring endpoints public | Medium | Grafana/Prometheus via Traefik | Auth middleware or internal only | Pending |
| Error message leakage | Low | `GlobalExceptionFilter` exposes `exception.message` | Sanitize in production | Pending |
| No WAF | Medium | Direct Traefik exposure | Cloudflare WAF rules | Planned |
| Docker socket mounts | Low | Required for Traefik/Watchtower | Standard; monitor access | Accepted |
| JWT not rotated | Low | Manual rotation only | Rotation playbook | Pending |
| No dependency scanning CI | Medium | No `npm audit` in pipeline | Add to CI | Pending |
| Backend Docker build | Medium | Workspace packages may fail silently | Fix monorepo context | In Progress |

---

## 3. Exposed Ports

| Port | Service | Risk |
|------|---------|------|
| 80 | Traefik HTTP | Expected (redirect to HTTPS) |
| 443 | Traefik HTTPS | Expected |
| 8080 | Traefik dashboard | **Should not be public in production** |

Application services (frontend:3000, backend:4000, cms:1337) are **not** directly exposed — routed through Traefik.

---

## 4. Authentication Security (planned)

| Control | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Bcrypt password hashing | Not implemented |
| JWT with TTL | Not implemented |
| Refresh token rotation | Not planned yet |
| Strapi users-permissions | Default (CMS API only) |
| Bearer auth in Swagger | Decorated, unused |

---

## 5. Security Roadmap

| Task | Priority | Effort | Sprint |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| Fix MinIO bucket policies | High | 4 hr | Sprint 2 |
| Enable SSL/TLS (ACME) | Critical | 1 day | Sprint 2 |
| Secure Traefik dashboard | High | 2 hr | Sprint 2 |
| Sanitize error responses | Medium | 2 hr | Sprint 1 |
| Add `npm audit` to CI | Medium | 2 hr | Sprint 2 |
| CMS admin IP allowlist | Medium | 4 hr | Sprint 3 |
| Cloudflare WAF rules | Medium | 1 day | Sprint 4 |
| Security event alerting | Low | 1 day | Sprint 5 |
| Secret rotation playbook | Low | 4 hr | Sprint 3 |

---

## 6. Compliance Considerations

| Standard | Relevance | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| OWASP Top 10 | Web app security | Partially addressed |
| GDPR | User data (future auth) | Not applicable yet |
| SOC 2 | Enterprise clients | Future consideration |

---

## 7. Summary

Structural security is excellent for a project at this stage. Operational hardening (TLS, bucket policies, dashboard lockdown, WAF) must complete before production launch. No critical secrets exposure detected in the repository.
