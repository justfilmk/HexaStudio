# HEXA Studio — IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
Version: 1.0

This roadmap outlines the strategic path to transform HEXA Studio into a world-class, award-winning architecture visualization platform.

## Phase 1: Design System & Foundation (The "Luxury" Base)
*Goal: Establish a pixel-perfect, consistent visual language.*

- [x] **Tailwind 4 Audit**: Refine colors, typography (luxury serif + modern sans), and spacing scales.
- [x] **Typography Hierarchy**: Implement a strict scale for headings and body text to create an editorial feel.
- [x] **Motion Core**: Setup GSAP and Framer Motion globals for consistent easing (`power3.out`).
- [x] **Global UI Refinement**: 
    - [x] Redesign `Navbar` and `Footer` for extreme minimalism.
    - [x] Polish `Button` and `Input` components for premium feel.
    - [x] Implement `CustomCursor` and `SmoothScroll` (Lenis) integration.

## Phase 2: The Cinematic Experience (3D & Immersive)
*Goal: Create the "Wow" factor that defines the brand.*

- [x] **Hero Experience**: 
    - [x] Develop a cinematic 3D landing scene (R3F).
    - [x] Implement camera storytelling (automated paths) on scroll.
    - [x] Add high-end lighting and post-processing (Bloom, SSAO, Chromatic Aberration).
- [x] **Project Viewer**: 
    - [x] Create an immersive 3D project showcase.
    - [x] Implement adaptive quality (LOD) based on device performance.
    - [x] Develop "hotspot" navigation within 3D spaces.
- [x] **Motion Storytelling**:
    - [x] Replace standard transitions with cinematic GSAP/Framer sequences.
    - [x] Implement "scroll-triggered" storytelling for the Home page.

## Phase 3: Page-by-Page Architectural Refinement
*Goal: Ensure every page feels handcrafted and intentional.*

- [x] **Home Page**: Transformation from "corporate" to "cinematic".
- [x] **Portfolio**: 
    - [x] Editorial layout with immersive imagery.
    - [x] Seamless transition from gallery to 3D view.
- [x] **Services**: Interactive visualization of services using motion and 3D elements.
- [x] **About & Contact**: Minimalist storytelling focusing on precision and luxury.
- [x] **Blog**: 
    - [x] High-end editorial layout for archives.
    - [x] Immersive article detail pages.

## Phase 4: Performance, A11y & Engineering Excellence
*Goal: Zero compromise on speed and accessibility.*

- [x] **3D Optimization**: 
    - [x] Integrate Draco compression for all GLTF models.
    - [x] Implement texture compression (Basis/KTX2).
    - [x] Optimize geometry and draw calls.
- [x] **Web Vitals**: 
    - [x] Target LCP < 1.2s.
    - [x] Zero CLS through proper aspect-ratio handling.
- [x] **Accessibility**: 
    - [x] Implement semantic DOM parallel to 3D scenes.
    - [x] Ensure full keyboard navigation for all 3D hotspots.
- [x] **Type Safety**: Ensure 100% type coverage from Strapi → NestJS → Frontend.

## Phase 5: Final Polish & Launch
*Goal: Emotional resonance and production readiness.*

- [x] **Brand Identity**: Real logo deployed (`logo.webp`), favicon, slogan, tagline.
- [x] **SEO Foundation**: JSON-LD structured data, dynamic metadata, robots.txt, sitemap.
- [x] **Sentry Config**: Error tracking configured (client/server/edge).
- [x] **Production Deployment**: 14 Docker services running on 19.16.1.100.
- [x] **Deploy Script**: `/opt/scripts/deploy.sh` with health checks.
- [x] **MCP Server**: Production + local dev MCP servers.
- [x] **OpenCode Server**: v1.17.13 installed on production.
- [x] **Security Hardening**: JWT cookies, env validation, network segmentation, Redis auth.
- [x] **SSL Certificate**: For `opencode.hexastudio.net` (DNS propagated, Traefik pending).
- [ ] **Visual Regression Testing**: Ensure pixel-perfection across all breakpoints.
- [ ] **Performance Audit**: Final Lighthouse check (Target >95).
- [ ] **Cloudflare WAF**: Web application firewall configuration.
- [ ] **DNS/SSL for Main Domain**: `hexastudio.net` → production IP.
- [x] **CI/CD Pipeline**: Auto-deploy on push to `main`.
